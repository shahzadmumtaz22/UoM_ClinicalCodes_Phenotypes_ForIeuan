### Primary Care

### Implementation

Study question:
What is the prevalence of different types of potentially
hazardous prescribing in general practice in the
United Kingdom, and what is the variation between
practices?

Methods:
A cross sectional study included all adult patients
potentially at risk of a prescribing or monitoring error
defined by a combination of diagnoses and
prescriptions in 526 general practices contributing to
the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) up to 1
April 2013. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of
potentially hazardous prescriptions of anticoagulants,
anti-platelets, NSAIDs, β blockers, glitazones,
metformin, digoxin, antipsychotics, combined
hormonal contraceptives, and oestrogens and
monitoring by blood test less frequently than
recommended for patients with repeated prescriptions
of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and loop
diuretics, amiodarone, methotrexate, lithium, or
warfarin.

Study answer and limitations
49 927 of 949 552 patients at risk triggered at least one
prescribing indicator (5.26%, 95% confidence interval
5.21% to 5.30%) and 21 501 of 182 721 (11.8%, 11.6% to
11.9%) triggered at least one monitoring indicator. The
prevalence of different types of potentially hazardous
prescribing ranged from almost zero to 10.2%, and for
inadequate monitoring ranged from 10.4% to 41.9%.
Older patients and those prescribed multiple repeat
medications had significantly higher risks of triggering a prescribing indicator whereas younger patients with
fewer repeat prescriptions had significantly higher risk
of triggering a monitoring indicator. There was high
variation between practices for some indicators.
Though prescribing safety indicators describe
prescribing patterns that can increase the risk of harm
to the patient and should generally be avoided, there
will always be exceptions where the indicator is
clinically justified. Furthermore there is the possibility
that some information is not captured by CPRD for
some practices—for example, INR results in patients
receiving warfarin.

What this study adds:
The high prevalence for certain indicators emphasises
existing prescribing risks and the need for their
appropriate consideration within primary care,
particularly for older patients and those taking
multiple medications. The high variation between
practices indicates potential for improvement through
targeted practice level intervention.
