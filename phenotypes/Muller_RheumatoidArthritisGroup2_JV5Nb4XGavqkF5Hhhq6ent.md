### Primary Care

{% include csv.html csvdata=site.data.codelists.Muller_RheumatoidArthritisGroup2_JV5Nb4XGavqkF5Hhhq6ent_Read %}

### Implementation

The original algorithm consisted of two
criteria. Individuals meeting at least one were
considered to have RA. Criterion 1: ≥1 RA Read code
and a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)
without an alternative indication. Criterion 2: ≥2 RA
Read codes, with at least one ‘strong’ code and no
alternative diagnoses. Lists of codes for consultations
and prescriptions were obtained from the authors of
the original algorithm where these were available, or
compiled based on the original description and clinical
knowledge. 4161 people with a first Read code for RA
between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2012 were
selected from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink
(CPRD, successor to the GPRD), and the criteria
applied.
