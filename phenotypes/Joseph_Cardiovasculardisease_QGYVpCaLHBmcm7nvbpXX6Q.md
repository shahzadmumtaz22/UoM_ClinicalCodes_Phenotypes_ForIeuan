### Implementation

Objective:
To investigate the association between smoking status and smoking cessation with mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods:
An incident cohort of patients with RA was identified using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a database of UK primary care electronic medical records. Time-varying smoking status, years of cessation, and amount smoked were
determined frompatientsâ€™medical records. The date and underlying cause of deathwere identified by linkagewith Office for National Statistics records. The associations between smoking status and smoking cessation with all-cause and causespecific
mortality (circulatory disease, all cancers, lung cancer, respiratory disease, and respiratory infection) were investigated using adjusted Cox (all-causemortality) and Fine-Gray (cause-specificmortality) regression.

Results: 
The cohort comprised 5,677 patients (median age 61.4 years, 68% women), with 40% as never smokers, 34% former smokers, and 26% current smokers at baseline. Compared to never smoking, current smokingwas associated with an increased
risk of all-causemortality (hazard ratio 1.98 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.56, 2.53]), andmortality due to circulatory disease (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] 1.96 [95% CI 1.33, 2.90]) and lung cancer (SHR 23.2 [95% CI 5.15, 105]). Each year of
smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality (former heavy smokers SHR 0.85 [95% CI 0.77, 0.94], former light smokers SHR 0.90 [95%CI 0.84, 0.97]).

Conclusion: 
Current smoking is associated with an increased risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, and lung cancermortality in patientswith RA. Each year of cessation is associated with a reduced risk of all-causemortality. This information may prove helpful in smoking cessation programs for patients with RA.
