### Implementation

Description of the data source:

This study was conducted using routinely collected data
from the CPRD, the world’s largest population-based, longitudinal,
primary care database. This data source contains
anonymised patient information entered by general practice
staff. Most clinical data is coded using the Read code
system and the database includes information on
diagnoses, demographics, laboratory tests, medications,
and referrals to other healthcare settings. Our study
utilised information from 677 general practices, with
10,396,605 patients contributing data at some stage during
years 2001–2013, inclusive. We restricted our analyses to
patients identified to be of an acceptable quality for
research, and registered with a general practice deemed to
be ‘up to standard’ on continuity of provision and data
completeness criteria. We utilised an ‘open’ cohort study
design in that each patient’s time at risk commenced at a
different time point, and some exited prior to the end of
the study period due to migration, death, or cessation of
their practice’s contribution to the CPRD.
Case definition and clinical coding
In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence (NICE) guidelines (CG16) define self-harm as
any act of “self-poisoning or self-injury, irrespective of
the apparent purpose”. Using this broad conceptualisation,
we developed a list of Read codes incorporating
all cases across the spectrum from milder forms of nonsuicidal
behaviour through to near-fatal suicide attempts.
Initially we searched for all Read codes that included the
following terms in their description: ‘deliberate’, ‘intentional’
or ‘self ’ (to identify episodes of self-harm/harming, selfinjury/
injurious behaviour, self-inflicted harm/injury,
harm/injury to self, self-poisoning, deliberate overdose,
intentional overdose) and ‘suicide attempt’, ‘attempted
suicide’ or ‘parasuicide’ (to identify suicide attempts).
These candidate codes were then subjected to rigorous
clinical review by two expert clinicians within the
research team (NK and JC), with any non-relevant codes
omitted. Additional potentially relevant codes were
identified using the hierarchical structure of the coding
system. We excluded codes that referred only to
thoughts of self-harm or suicidal ideation and alcoholrelated
codes, unless intent to actively harm oneself was
specified. 

Self-harm frequency measures:
Calculating a rate based on the total number of general
practice consultations could be dominated unduly by
frequent attenders. We therefore deployed a dual approach
at the patient-level to investigate: (i) rates of new
cases in the population (incidence); (ii) the proportion of
patients affected annually (presentation rates). We restricted
our study to this more recent time period to
maximise data quality and the relevance of our findings.
Patients were eligible for inclusion in a given year if they
were aged 15–64 years and registered with a CPRDcontributing
practice at the start of the year. The rationale
for imposing these age restrictions was that the
determinants and implications of self-harm in children
and older adults are quite distinct from those of the rest
of the population, and therefore warrant separate investigation
and consideration. Among older persons who harm
themselves, specific mechanisms such as bereavement,loneliness and social isolation and physical illness,
multi-morbidity and impairment play a predominant
role; children aged below 15 years who harm themselves
tend to have an unusually low suicidal intent, and this
behaviour is associated with a relatively low long-term risk
of suicide.

Incidence:
When calculating incidence rates, denominator estimates
were restricted to patients registered at the start of the
year with a practice that contributed data throughout the
year. Patients with a history of self-harm were excluded.
The numerators were estimated as the number of patients
included in the denominator with a first recorded episode
of self-harm during the year. We excluded patients who
were no longer registered on the episode date.
Annual presentation rates
Denominator estimates were restricted to patients registered
at the start of the year with a practice that contributed
data throughout the year. No restriction was placed
regarding prior episodes of self-harm. The numerators
were estimated as the number included in the denominator,
with one or more presentations of self-harm during
the year, and still registered on the first of those
presentations.
Gender-specific estimates of incidence and annual
presentation rates are presented throughout. We report
stratified analyses by age (10-year bands), nation
(England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales), and
socio-economic deprivation quintiles from 1 (least) to
5 (most deprived).

Measurement of deprivation:
Deprivation quintiles were applied according to the postcode
of the general practice of registration, and were derived
using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) for
2010 in each of the four UK nations. The specification
differs slightly for each nation, but throughout
the UK the IMD is a measure of area-level deprivation
constructed from domains including income, employment,
health, education, barriers to services (including
housing), crime, and general living environment. In
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the
indices are derived for geographical areas designated as
Lower-layer Super Output Areas (LSOA’s), which contain
1000–3000 people and are Census-derived. In
Scotland, the small area concentrations are called datazones. The IMD provides a means of ranking and
assessing whether an area is more/less deprived than
others in the same nation.

Statistical analyses:
The focus of our investigation was comparison of selfharm
risk between subgroups of the UK population. Firstly,
we compared rates for male versus female patients. Secondly,
we conducted gender-specific comparisons across
age bands, nations, and deprivation quintiles. Crude rate
comparisons could have been misleading if the populations
being compared had differed significantly with respect to
potential confounders. Therefore, to enhance comparability,
all subgroup rates were directly standardised for
age, geographical region, and deprivation quintile. We
derived directly standardised rates by applying categoryspecific
rates from each subgroup to the demographic
distribution of the total CPRD population to produce
group-specific rates that would have been observed if the
subgroups all had the same distribution. Rates per 10,000
patients are reported as 3-year moving averages, centred
on the middle year of each 3-year period.
Variations between demographic subgroups were examined
formally using Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios,
stratified by study year. Chi-squared tests were applied
to assess homogeneity of rates over time and logistic regression
to test for temporal linear trends. Each test for
trend involved fitting two regression models with time
represented as a categorical variable in the first and as a
continuous variable in the second. Linear trends were
confirmed if a likelihood ratio test on the two models
was non-significant but the effect of time was significant
in the second model. Significance was assessed at an α
level of 0.05 (two-sided). All of the analyses were
conducted using Stata version 13.
