### Implementation

Design: Population-based case-control study in children
1 to 19 years of age.

Setting: Primary care, General Practice Research Database,
United Kingdom, 1994-2007.
Participants: Cases were children who had MRSA diagnosed
as outpatients, and controls were individually
matched on age and practice, with the matched caseâ€™s diagnosis
date as the index date for both.
Main Exposures: Antibacterial agents prescribed 180
to 30 days prior to the index date, excluding prescriptions
30 days before the index date to prevent protopathic
bias.

Outcome Measures: Rate ratios (RRs) estimated from
the odds ratios of exposure in cases compared with controls
using conditional logistic regression, adjusted for comorbid conditions, other prescription drug use, and
hospitalization.

Results: The rate of MRSA was 4.5 per 100 000 per year.
Of 297 cases and 9357 controls, 52.5% and 13.6%, respectively,
received antibacterial drug prescriptions during
the 150-day exposure window. The adjusted RR with
any antibacterial drug was 3.5 (95% confidence interval
[CI], 2.6-4.8). The RRs increased with the number of prescriptions
(2.2 [95% CI, 1.5-3.2], 3.3 [95% CI, 1.9-5.6],
11.0 [95% CI, 5.6-21.6], and 18.2 [95% CI, 9.4-35.4] for
1, 2, 3, and >=4 prescriptions, respectively). The RR was
particularly elevated for quinolones at 14.8 (95% CI, 3.9-
55.8), with wide variation among antibacterial classes.
