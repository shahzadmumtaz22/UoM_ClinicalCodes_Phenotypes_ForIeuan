### Implementation

This was an indication–prescription descriptive cross-sectional study using
data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a computerized database
of consultation data from 570 general practices that use the Vision
practice software system, covering 3.8 million active patients (resulting in
68 million patient–years of data). The population covered has similar
demographic characteristics to the national UK population,and the
recording of consultations and prescriptions is comparable to national
levels. Data are validated to ensure that they meet quality standards12
and data quality compliance dates are included to show when practices
meet recording standards: practice data were only included in our analyses
after the later of the acceptable mortality reporting date or the
acceptable computer usage date, resulting in 537 practices being
included in our study.
Diagnosis and prescribing data at the individual (anonymized) patient
level were linked to determine the condition for which the antimicrobial
was prescribed. For each clinical syndrome a list of search terms (keywords
and synonyms) was produced and used to search the descriptions
in the Read code dictionary. In the resulting Read code list, code stems
were searched to include all codes containing the specified sequence of
characters. This list was then pruned by two medical epidemiologists
(J. I. H. and G. E. S.) to decide on the codes to be included for each condition
and were checked by A. C. H., A. P. J. and D. M. F. Code lists were constructed
for specificity rather than sensitivity (e.g. tonsillitis, but not influenza, was
included in the sore throat list) and codes were excluded if they were likely
to contain a significant number of consultations for which the relevant
SMAC/PHLS recommendation was likely to be inappropriate: for example,
those sore throats that were recorded as ‘bacterial’ or ‘streptococcal’ were
excluded fromthe sore throat code list, and the UTI code list did not include
chronic or recurring infections, kidney infections or conditions related
to pregnancy (the code lists are available in Table S1, available as
Supplementary data at JACOnline). The drug code list included all antibiotics
in Chapter 5.1 of the British National Formulary, excluding antituberculosis
drugs and antileprotic drugs. A prescription was linked to a consultation if
both occurred on the same date. An episode of acute infection was defined
as a newly recorded diagnosis that was not preceded by a consultation for
the same diagnosis reported in the previous 14 days.
Stata v12 survival analysis commands were used to obtain overall incidence
rates for each clinical condition in total and those cases prescribed
an antibiotic. Yearly changes were assessed by calculating CIs reflecting
the average change in percentiles year on year within practices, thereby
removing the effect of between-practice variation. Variation by practice
was illustrated by a funnel plot, which allowed an inspection of random variation according to practice size and was presented as a range from
the 10th percentile to the 90th percentile (TNPR) or IQR to exclude outlying
practices that might be atypical. The variation in the proportion of patients
prescribed antibiotics was analysed by age group (0–4, 5–14, 15–24,
25–54, 55–64, 65–74, 75–84 and 85–94 years) and, for the cough/
cold indicator, by socioeconomic status, using quintiles of increasing
deprivation provided in the THIN database (derived from Townsend
scores based on patients’ postcodes). For UTI, only women aged
16–74 years were included, and for trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin
prescriptions the course length was calculated by dividing the ‘quantity
prescribed’ field by the ‘calculated daily dosage’ field.
The protocol for this work was approved by the THIN Scientific Review
Committee (SRC ref 12-002). No patient-identifiable data were used and
no new information was collected for this project.
