### Primary Care

{% include csv.html csvdata=site.data.codelists.Reilly_Dementia_4unLRacbbkFMQeXY9E7dRj_OXMISRead %}

### Implementation

Objectives: 
Little is known about the prevalence of comorbidity rates in people with severe mental illness (SMI) in UK primary care. We calculated the prevalence of SMI by UK country, English region and deprivation quintile, antipsychotic and antidepressant medication prescription rates for people with SMI, and prevalence rates of common comorbidities in people with SMI compared with people without SMI.

Design: 
Retrospective cohort study from 2000 to 2012.

Setting: 
627 general practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a UK primary care database.

Participants: 
Each identified case (346 551) was matched for age, sex and general practice with 5 randomly selected control cases (1 732 755) with no diagnosis of SMI in each yearly time point.

Outcome measures: 
Prevalence rates were calculated for 16 conditions.
