### Primary Care

### Implementation

Methods: 
Data were drawn from the UK General Practice Research Database. Analyses evaluated the occurrence of 271
READ medical diagnostic codes, including categories for ‘Angina’, ‘Myocardial Infarction’, ‘Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting’
(CABG), ‘percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty’ (PCTA) and ‘Other Coronary Heart Disease’. Time-to-event
analyses were implemented to evaluate occurrences of different groups of codes after the index date.

Results: 
Among 300,020 participants aged greater than 30 years there were 75,197 unique occurrences of coronary heart
disease codes in 24,244 participants, with 12,495 codes for incident events and 62,702 for prevalent events. Among incident
event codes, 3,607 (28.87%) were for angina, 3,262 (26.11%) were for MI, 514 (4.11%) for PCTA, 161 (1.29%) for CABG and
4,951 (39.62%) were for ‘Other CHD’. Among prevalent codes, 20,254 (32.30%) were for angina, 3,644 (5.81%) for MI, 34,542
(55.09%) for ‘Other CHD’ and 4,262 (6.80%) for CABG or PCTA. Among 3,685 participants initially diagnosed exclusively with
‘Other CHD’ codes, 17.1% were recorded with angina within 5 years, 5.6% with myocardial infarction, 6.3% with CABG and
8.6% with PCTA. From 2000 to 2010, the overall incidence of CHD declined, as did the incidence of angina, but the incidence
of MI did not change. The frequency of CABG declined, while PCTA increased.
