### Primary Care

{% include csv.html csvdata=site.data.codelists.Wright_Uppergastrointestinalmalignancy_MkfBvFxj5oi826f4ouaPwh_Read2 %}

### Implementation

Methodology/ Principal Findings: 

Design-A case control study comparing bisphosphonate prescribing in cases of upper GI
cancer from 1995 to 2007 using UK primary care electronic health records (GPRD). Main Outcome Measure-Relative Risk
(approximated to Odds Ratio for rare events) for oesophageal and gastric cancer development in bisphosphonate users
compared to non–users. The odds of being a case of oesophageal cancer, adjusted for smoking status, were significantly
increased in women who had had one or more bisphosphonate prescriptions, odds ratio 1?54 (95% CI 1.27–1.88) compared
to non-users. There was no significant effect on gastric cancer in women, odds ratio adjusted for smoking status, 1.06 (95%
CI 0.83–1.37) and also no apparent risk in men for either oesophageal or gastric cancer, odds ratio adjusted for smoking
status 0.78 (95%CI 0.56–1.09) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.55–1.36) respectively.
