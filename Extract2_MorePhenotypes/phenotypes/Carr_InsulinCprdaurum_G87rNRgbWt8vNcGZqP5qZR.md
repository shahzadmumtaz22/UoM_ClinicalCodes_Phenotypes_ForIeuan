### Primary Care

{% include csv.html csvdata=site.data.codelists.Carr_InsulinCprdaurum_G87rNRgbWt8vNcGZqP5qZR_CPRDProductCode %}

### Implementation

We generated a cohort of 25 million patients from 1831 UK general practices registered with the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum (inEngland) and CPRD GOLD (in Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) databases. The cohort included 14 929 251 patients (median age 41 years [IQR 25–59]; 7 461 565 [50·0%] of whom were women), who were followed between March 1 and Dec 10, 2020. We aimed to compare: (1) the UK-wide incidence of type 2 diabetes; (2) the frequency of HbA1c testing; and (3) mortality in people with type 2 diabetes, by nation, before and after the first nationwide COVID-19 lockdown, which began in March 23, 2020 (appendix pp 1–3). There were 790 377 (5·3%) people with type 2 diabetes in the cohort (median age 67 years (IQR 57–76); 348 515 (44·1%) of whom were women).
